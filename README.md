# Login-With-MonogoDB
Here is a basic login authentication system that was created alongside my full-stack project, [CarSpotters](https://github.com/Macpickle/CarSpotters). Feel free to check it out and provide pointers.

# Information
This uses many modules to run a local server to host a simple login and register using modules such as Express, Passport and Bcrypt. It was also programmed to be used by a MongoDB database, and is able to be easily added. Check other sources to figure out how to start a database. This website is very bare bones (aka. no styling) so feel free to edit it however.

# Getting Started

```
npm install npm@latest -g
```

2. Clone REPO
```
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git

4. Set the .env file variables (SECRET_KEY, DATABASE_URL and PORT)
```
